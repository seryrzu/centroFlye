# centroFlye


**Disclaimer:** To replicate the assemblies from the Nature Biotechnology paper (see `Publications`), please consider branch `cF_NatBiotech_paper_Xv0.8.3-6v0.1.3`.
The version of centroFlye (and the corresponding assemblies) in `master` branch can be more recent.

### Version 0.8.3 cenX + 0.1.3 cen6
## Overview
centroFlye (Bzikadze et al., 2020) is an algorithm for centromere assembly using long error-prone reads.
Currently it supports assembly of a human centromere 6 (referred to as cen6) and X (referred to as cenX).
Here we show how to apply it for the cen6 and cenX of the CHM13hTERT human cell line.
The comparison of various cenX assemblies can be found in Bzikadze et al., 2020 and Mikheenko et al., 2020.

## Quick start guide for cenX (centroFlye)

If you want to run the whole centroFlye pipeline to generate cenX assembly with one command, please run
```
./run_all_cenX.sh <path_to_CHM13> results_cenX 50
```
You can customize the output directory and the number of threads:
```
./run_all_cenX.sh <path_to_CHM13> <output directory> <number of threads>
```
All intermediate and final results will then be placed in `<output directory>`.
If you want to start from scratch you can simply remove this directory.

**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: ~150GB (mostly from the first step "Recruitment of centromeric reads", see below)
+ Clock time: ~9 hours (mostly recruitment of unique k-mers)
+ RAM: peak usage up to 800GB


## Pipeline for cenX (centroFlye)
In this manual we go step-by-step demonstrating centroFlye algorithm.
The detailed information about the algorithm can be found in the paper.

Please, run all commands from the root of the repository.
Results of all steps will be stored at `results_cenX` directory.

### 1. Recruitment of cenX reads

We use 50x ultra-long Oxford Nanopore dataset generated by [Telomere2Telomere Consorsium](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13), rel2.
This step is run directly on the reads at the [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/rel2/rel2.fastq.gz).
The following bash script splits the input file in 50 files and runs DXZ1-based recruitment in 50 threads.
DXZ1 is supplied in the current repo at ``supplementary_data/DXZ1_rc.fasta``.
The result of this step is a fasta file with centromeric reads that is stored at `results_cenX/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta`

From the root of the project run 
```
make -C scripts/read_recruitment
```
and start recruitment (`<path_to_CHM13>` is where the ONT reads are located, see section `Dependencies/Data`):
```
bash scripts/read_recruitment/run_read_recruitment.sh \
       <path_to_CHM13>/rel2.fastq.gz \
       results_cenX/centromeric_reads 50 11100000
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: 150GB
+ Clock time: 1 hour
+ RAM: < 50MB

### 2. Applying centroFlye to cenX reads
At this step we are utilizing centromeric reads from step 1 and run centroFlye on them.
The result of this step is the final cenX assembly that is stored at `results_cenX/final_assembly.fasta`.
The following command uses 50 threads.

```
python centroFlye.py \
            --coverage 32 \
            --reads results_cenX/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta \
            -t 50 \
            --outdir results_cenX \
            --unit supplementary_data/DXZ1_rc.fasta
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: < 3GB
+ Clock time: ~9 hours (mostly recruitment of unique k-mers)
+ RAM: peak usage up to 800GB


## Quick start guide for cen6 (centroFlyeMono)

centroFlye has a special module centroFlyeMono that uses only alpha satellite structure to assemble centromeres.
The steps below describe how to apply it to cen6 assembly.

If you want to run the whole centroFlyeMono pipeline to generate cen6 assembly with one command, please run
```
./run_all_cen6.sh <path_to_CHM13> results_cen6 50
```
You can customize the output directory and the number of threads:
```
./run_all_cen6.sh <path_to_CHM13> <output directory> <number of threads>
```
All intermediate and final results will then be placed in `<output directory>`.
If you want to start from scratch you can simply remove this directory.


## Pipeline for cen6 (centroFlyeMono)
In this manual we go step-by-step demonstrating centroFlyeMono algorithm.
The detailed information about the algorithm can be found in the paper.

Please, run all commands from the root of the repository.
Results of all steps will be stored at `results_cen6` directory.


### 1. Recruitment of cen6 reads

We use 120x ultra-long Oxford Nanopore dataset generated by [Telomere2Telomere Consorsium](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13), rel3.
This step is run directly on the reads at the [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/rel3/rel3.fastq.gz).
The following bash script splits the input file in 50 files and runs D6Z1-based recruitment in 50 threads.
D6Z1 is supplied in the current repo at ``supplementary_data/D6Z1.fasta``.
The result of this step is a fasta file with centromeric reads that is stored at `results_cen6/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta`

From the root of the project run 
```
make -C scripts/read_recruitment
```
and start recruitment (`<path_to_CHM13>` is where the ONT reads are located, see section `Dependencies/Data`):
```
bash scripts/read_recruitment/run_read_recruitment.sh \
       <path_to_CHM13>/rel3.fastq.gz \
       results_cen6/centromeric_reads 50 29000000 \
       supplementary_data/D6Z1.fasta \
       550
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: 150GB
+ Clock time: 1 hour
+ RAM: < 50MB


### 2. Running String Decomposer on cen6 reads

We use String Decomposer (SD; Dvorkina et al., 2020) to partition cen6 reads into distinct monomers of D6Z1.
These monomers are supplied in the current repo at ``supplementary_data/D6Z1_monomers.fasta``.
The result of this step is the report of SD which is stored at `results_cen6/string_decomposer_report`

The following commands take 50 threads
```
python scripts/ext/stringdecomposer/longreads_decomposer.py \
            -s results_cen6/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta \
            -m supplementary_data/D6Z1_monomers.fasta \
            -t 50
mkdir results_cen6/string_decomposer_report
mv decomposition{.tsv,_alt.tsv} results_cen6/string_decomposer_report
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: 6GB
+ Clock time: 9h
+ RAM: < 10GB


### 3. Running centroFlyeMono on cen6 reads using SD output

At this step we are utilizing string decomposer output on cen6 reads and run centromFlyeMono on them.
The final cen6 assembly is located in `results_cen6/centroFlyeMono_cen6/polishing/scaffold_0/scaffold_0.fasta`.
```
python scripts/centroFlyeMono.py \
       --sd-report results_cen6/string_decomposer_report/decomposition.tsv \
       --monomers supplementary_data/D6Z1_monomers.fasta \
       --centromeric-reads results_cen6/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta \
       --outdir results_cen6/centroFlyeMono_cen6
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: 120MB
+ Clock time: 30 mins
+ RAM: < 1GB
